# Javascript-based-PHP-template
I have created a webpage that is able to successfully use cache and communicate with the server using AJAX requests.

# Target problem
Using **Magicsuggest** library to demonstrate its features

To demonstrate the use of custom **cache** as Javascript global variable

Using jquery for **AJAX** requests

Using the **“If-Modified-Since”** request header and **“304 Not Modified”**  response

**Auto-refreshing** the foreground data displayed as well as background cache

# Benefits
Cache reduces the need for the browser to communicate with the server and hence, reduces server load

Background refresh keeps the cache up-to-date for quicker response when the user requests for it

Foreground refresh allows real-time data to display without the need to refresh the webpage
